#A-Frame first try

This repo shall work as a playground for me to explore, what I can do with
A-Frame framework by Mozilla.

I'm using [BASETech VR glasses](https://www.conrad.de/de/basetech-g-01-schwarz-virtual-reality-brille-1456965.html)
as my reference device, since it is quite cheap, more robust than Google
cardboard (in terms of material). The image quality of VR in general isn't that
high right now, so I see no point in buying an Oculus Rift or Hive.
